1. Design from : https://sandraisrael.github.io/Memory-Game-fend/
2. Rules : 
a) You have to click on two random cards and if they are of same icon then their background becomes green and if they are of different icon then then their background becomes red and after some time they will flip over automatically.
b) So, the main catch in the game is that we have to remember the places of each card so that we can make pair of each card in less time and in less moves.
c) This game contains 3 levels and the difference between the levels is the number of cards in each level.
